# Noto-heat_equation

This git provides a code simulating the diffusion of heat on a 2D square domain. 
Two situations are studied, thermalisation of two metallic blocs and the diffusion of a pointlike heat source. 

Another file is provided giving a simulation for Turing patterns arising from the interaction of two substances on a two dimensions grid. 
This code was created by Salomon Guinchard for an EPFL JupyterNotebook and is open-source under MIT licence.
